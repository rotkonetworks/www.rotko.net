## KVM

[BliKVM v1 CM4 "KVM over IP" Raspberry Pi CM4 HDMI CSI PiKVM v3](https://aliexpress.com/item/1005003262886521.html)

A modern, highly secure, and programmable KVM solution running on Arch Linux,
which provides exceptional control over your server, akin to physical access.
With an easy build process, it boasts minimal video latency (about 100 ms) and
a lightweight Web UI accessible from any browser. It emulates mass storage
drives and allows ATX power management, secure data transmission with SSL, and
local Raspberry Pi health monitoring. You can also manage GPIO and USB relays
via its web interface. The PiKVM OS is production-ready, supports a read-only
filesystem to prevent memory card damage, offers extensible authorization
methods, and enables automation with macros.


### Features of PiKVM:

- **Fully-featured and modern IP-KVM:** PiKVM is up-to-date with the latest KVM technologies.
- **Easy to build:** PiKVM offers ready-to-use OS images and a friendly build environment.
- **Low video latency:** With approximately 100 milliseconds of video latency, it provides
one of the smallest delays of all existing solutions.
- **Lightweight Web UI and VNC:** The user interface is accessible through any browser,
with no proprietary clients required. VNC is also supported.
- **Mass Storage Drive Emulation:** On Raspberry Pi 4 and ZeroW, PiKVM can emulate a virtual
CD-ROM or Flash Drive. A live image can be uploaded to boot the attached server.
- **ATX power management:** PiKVM supports simple circuits for controlling the power
button of the attached server.
- **Security:** PiKVM is designed with strong security, using SSL to protect traffic.

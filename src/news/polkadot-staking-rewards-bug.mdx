asset hub migration introduced bug in staking rewards calculation.

wrong `fixed_total_issuance` value (5.2T instead of 15.0T) caused uniform 65% reduction across all validators and nominators since era 1981.

fix already merged: [polkadot-fellows/runtimes#998](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/pull/998)

deployment eta: few days

reimbursement planned for all affected accounts

**this affects entire network uniformly** - not validator-specific performance.

side effect: era timing shifted from 15:36 to 03:36 utc.

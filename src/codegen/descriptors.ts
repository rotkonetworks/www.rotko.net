// Generated chain descriptors for Polkadot-API
// These provide typed APIs for each chain

export const dot = {} as any  // Polkadot descriptor
export const ksm = {} as any  // Kusama descriptor
export const pas = {} as any  // Paseo descriptor

// For now we'll use a simplified interface that matches what we need
// In production, these would be generated from chain metadata

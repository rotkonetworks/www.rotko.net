# x11q

**X11 over QUIC** — Remote display forwarding with P2P NAT traversal. No video encoding, no compression artifacts. Your local GPU renders everything.

## Why x11q

Traditional remote desktop solutions encode video on the server, introducing latency and compression artifacts. x11q forwards raw X11 protocol over QUIC, letting your local machine handle all rendering.

Built on [iroh](https://iroh.computer/) for automatic NAT traversal — works behind any NAT without port forwarding.

## Features

- **No video encoding** — raw X11 protocol, local GPU rendering
- **P2P holepunching** — automatic NAT traversal via mainline DHT (bittorrent)
- **Word codes** — magic-wormhole style short codes for easy connection
- **SPAKE2 auth** — password-authenticated key exchange prevents MITM
- **QUIC transport** — low latency, multiplexed streams, TLS encrypted

## Installation

```bash
cargo install x11q
```

## Usage

### Easy Mode (word codes)

Like magic-wormhole — share a short code to connect.

**On your local machine (has your monitor):**
```bash
x11q serve
# Prints: x11q join 7-tiger-lamp
```

**On remote machine (runs your apps):**
```bash
x11q join 7-tiger-lamp
# Creates DISPLAY=:99

DISPLAY=:99 bspwm &
DISPLAY=:99 alacritty
```

### Direct Mode (node IDs)

For persistent setups without DHT lookup.

**Local:**
```bash
x11q server
# Prints node ID
```

**Remote:**
```bash
x11q client NODE_ID
# Creates DISPLAY=:99
```

### Mirror Mode (screen sharing)

```bash
# Share your screen
x11q mirror-server

# View remote screen
x11q mirror NODE_ID
```

## How It Works

```
Remote: [bspwm] -> DISPLAY=:99 -> x11q join
                                      |
                      (iroh: holepunch via mainline DHT)
                                      |
Local:  [Xorg :0] <- x11q serve <-----+
```

1. `serve` generates word code, publishes node ID to mainline DHT
2. `join` looks up node ID from DHT using word code
3. SPAKE2 key exchange authenticates both sides
4. iroh establishes P2P connection (holepunch or relay)
5. X11 protocol streams over QUIC
6. Your local GPU renders everything

Result: minimal latency, no compression artifacts, works behind any NAT.

## Security

- Word codes have ~16 bits entropy (2 words from 256-word list)
- SPAKE2 PAKE prevents MITM even if attacker knows the code
- All traffic encrypted via QUIC/TLS
- DHT records expire after 2 minutes

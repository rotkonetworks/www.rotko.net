# Githem

**Repository to LLM-ready text** — A high-performance tool for converting git repositories into optimized text formats for Large Language Models.

## Features

- **Smart Filtering** — Automatically removes build artifacts, node_modules, and other noise
- **60-80% Size Reduction** — Optimized presets reduce token usage significantly
- **Fast Performance** — Built for speed with intelligent caching
- **Multiple Input Methods** — Support for local repos, GitHub URLs, and direct API access
- **Flexible Output** — Choose presets or customize with include/exclude patterns

## Installation

### Unix/Linux/macOS
```bash
curl -fsSL get.githem.com | sh
```

### Windows
```powershell
iwr -useb get.githem.com/install.ps1 | iex
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Process any GitHub repository
githem owner/repo

# Process current directory
githem .

# Process with full URL
githem https://github.com/owner/repo
```

## Options

```
-o FILE       output to file
-i PATTERN    include patterns (use / for directories)
-e PATTERN    exclude patterns
-b BRANCH     branch
--preset NAME filter preset
--stats       show statistics
```

## Presets

- **`raw`** — No filtering, complete repository contents
- **`standard`** — Default smart filtering (recommended)
- **`code-only`** — Source code files only, no docs or configs
- **`minimal`** — Basic filtering for smaller output

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Process any GitHub repository
githem owner/repo

# Process current directory
githem .

# Process with full URL
githem https://github.com/owner/repo
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Use specific preset for code-only output
githem owner/repo --preset code-only

# Include only specific patterns (use / for directories)
githem . -i "src/, api/, core/"

# Include specific file types
githem . -i "*.rs" -e "tests/*"

# Output to file instead of stdout
githem owner/repo -o output.txt

# Process specific branch
githem owner/repo -b develop

# Compare branches
githem owner/repo/compare/main...feature

# Show token statistics
githem owner/repo --stats
```

## Cache Management

```bash
# View cache statistics
githem --cache-stats

# Clear entire cache
githem --clear-cache

# Bypass cache for fresh fetch
githem owner/repo --no-cache
```

## Web API

Githem provides a RESTful API for programmatic access:

```bash
# Basic repository fetch
curl https://githem.com/owner/repo

# With preset
curl "https://githem.com/owner/repo?preset=code-only"

# Include specific patterns
curl "https://githem.com/owner/repo?include=core/,api/"
```

### Available Endpoints

- **`GET /owner/repo`** — Fetch repository content
- **`GET /owner/repo/tree/branch/path`** — Browse repository tree
- **`GET /owner/repo/compare/base...head`** — Compare branches
- **`POST /api/ingest`** — Submit repository for processing
- **`GET /api/result/{id}`** — Retrieve processed result
- **`GET /api/download/{id}`** — Download as file
- **`GET /health`** — Service health check

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What files are filtered by default?
The standard preset filters out:
- Package directories: `node_modules/`, `vendor/`, `.venv/`
- Build artifacts: `dist/`, `build/`, `target/`, `*.pyc`
- Media files: images, videos, fonts
- Binary files: executables, compiled objects
- Lock files: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Cargo.lock`

### How do I process private repositories?
For private repos, use SSH authentication:
```bash
githem git@github.com:company/private-repo.git
```

### What's the typical size reduction?
- **Standard preset**: 60-80% reduction
- **Code-only preset**: 70-90% reduction
- **Minimal preset**: 40-60% reduction

### How are tokens estimated?
Approximately 1 token per 4 characters. Use `--stats` flag to see exact counts for your content.

### Can I use it programmatically?
Yes! Use our REST API at `https://githem.com` or integrate the CLI into your scripts.

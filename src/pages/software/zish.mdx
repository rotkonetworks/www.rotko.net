# zish

**Fast shell in Zig** — An opinionated, high-performance shell with native vim mode and syntax highlighting.

## Why zish

Modern shells carry decades of compatibility baggage. zish starts fresh with zig, achieving 3-7x faster execution than bash/zsh while providing a full vim-style editing experience.

## Features

- **Vim mode** — full text objects, visual mode, operators (d/c/y with i/a modifiers)
- **Git prompt** — optional branch/status display
- **Syntax highlighting** — real-time as you type
- **Tab completion** — with common prefix detection
- **Persistent history** — across sessions
- **Parameter expansion** — `${VAR:-default}` syntax
- **Test expressions** — `[[ ]]` conditionals
- **Command chaining** — pipes, redirects, `&&`, `||`
- **Command/math substitution** — `$(cmd)` and `$((math))`

## Performance

| test | vs bash | vs zsh |
|------|---------|--------|
| command substitution | **7.0x faster** | **7.0x faster** |
| nested loops | **4.0x faster** | **4.4x faster** |
| conditionals | **4.0x faster** | **4.5x faster** |
| arithmetic | **3.8x faster** | **4.3x faster** |
| variables | **3.6x faster** | **3.9x faster** |
| functions | **3.4x faster** | **3.8x faster** |
| pipelines | **1.7x faster** | **1.9x faster** |

Why it's fast:
- **Static binary** — no dynamic linker overhead
- **Stack buffers** — echo/test builtins avoid malloc in loops
- **Minimal init** — no readline/job control setup for `-c` mode

## Installation

```bash
zig build --release=fast
./zig-out/bin/zish
```

## Vim Mode

Zish has vim-style modal editing enabled by default.

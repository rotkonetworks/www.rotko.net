- Paseo: Community testnet for Polkadot (0% APY, 99.98% uptime)

## Philosophy

- Linux First: Everything runs on Linux. Kernel to container. No Windows tax, no license fees, no black boxes.
- Own the Stack: From BGP announcements to application deployments. No 'contact support' when things break at 3am.
- Build for Ourselves: Every service we offer runs our own infrastructure first. We're the most demanding users of our platform.
- Radical Transparency: Public status pages, open-source tools, detailed postmortems. Trust is earned through transparency, not marketing.
